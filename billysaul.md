##These Mainers tour with a pop star. This is what it's like

###Billy Libby, 31, Portland

####How did you guys get in the band?

I wound up in the band through Saul. Saul went to high school with (ry) the drummer of my previous band Even All Out and connected us when I moved to NYC about 5 years ago. Saul really helped me integrate into the scene of musicians in NYC and through him I ended up meeting, playing and writing with other members of the Ingrid band.

####What's the average day like on a big tour?

I feel like there really is no average day on tour. There are a few things you can count on like show time and sound check every day, but besides that it really depends on where we are and who ever else is up and on the bus when you wake up. Sometimes we are in a city and a few people will go for a walk and get coffee or try and find a gym. Often times we will try and do something that really highlights the character of the city we are in or just something cool like going to pike place market in Seattle or an aquarium or something like that. Other days we are at a venue which is sort of far away from anything and we just sort of hang on the bus or in the green room. But in general I feel like there are mellow days on tour where we just exercise, shower, sound check eat together and watch the openers. Or some busier days where we try and cram a bunch of things in. It also depends on the tour - on our first tour we were doing a ton of radio promoting "Girls Chase Boys" and those were really long days - we'd play at a radio station at noon for about 20 minutes and then sound check and then play.

####What's the coolest thing you've seen or done since you started playing with Ingrid?

The coolest thing actually just happened, which was playing Red Rocks in Colorado with the Colorado Symphony. Hearing those arrangements and being at that venue was incredibly moving. I actually saw Ingrid at that venue 3 years ago and remember asking myself, "I wonder if I will ever get to play here..." To actually be playing there with her was a pretty full circle moment. Beyond that the coolest thing and the strangest thing is realizing how much you are doing in such a short amount of time. On this tour we've rented cars on our days off to drive to some really cool sights near where we are having days off. We went to White Sands National Monument in New Mexico and then a few days later we went swimming in Lake Tahoe and then a few days earlier were biking around North Carolina. It's just wild to think...oh when was Seattle? Five days ago. The whole experience is the coolest. I get to go to play music and go on adventures with some of my favorite people. We also get to say good night and good morning to each other every day. I really love that.

####Would you have been at this point your careers had you stayed in Maine? Any advice for Maine musicians?
-
It's hard to say. I feel pretty sure that I have this opportunity because I moved to NYC to throw myself into the fire. It's funny though that the reason I'm in the band is because of a Maine connection. There are lots of people that have done things outside of Maine, but I feel like it really can be difficult in some ways. I was and still consider myself a part of the Maine music scene. I feel there is a great community there but there can be a glass ceiling if you don't actively try and make your presence known outside of Maine. For me it meant moving, because I felt I needed to be in a place that would beat me up and then make me ask myself how bad I really wanted to be a musician. I discovered a lot of opportunities that I didn't know about before I moved and I am grateful for that. I am also grateful for the experiences I've had in Maine. I cman't imagine what my musical life would have been without the Maine music scene.

####After playing smaller clubs in Maine early in your career, how does it feel to come back here and play a 5,000-seat venue?

It's a pretty amazing feeling. I get really nostalgic any time a life event happens that seems to bookmark a time in life or just capture it. Playing at a venue like that with family and friends and a lifetime of good and bad experiences to get there is really wild. It's interesting in a lot of ways too because when I was in Maine i was pretty much always playing with my own bands. I never really expected to be playing with other people, but I love it and am so thankful for the opportunity I have and excited about what else can happen. It's a reminder that thing's won't always turn out how you might expect them to, but if you are passionate about something and open to new things then you can wind up in a great place.

//Here are Saul's answers.

####How did you guys get in the band?

SM : I had the opportunity to work on two of Ingrid's albums and was formally inducted by her producer at the time and one of my closest friends, Dan Romer. I've also been tightly connected to a community of musicians since college, which includes much of the band.

####What's the average day like on a big tour?

SM : There really is no average day for me, however, if I plan my prior evening right and wake at a reasonable hour, it includes but isn't limited to : a fitness center / yoga mat, good coffee/food, a solid bike ride and maybe a thrift store or adventure. The rest is mostly relaxing, biz, soundcheck, partying and a show.

####For Saul, how have live shows and touring life changed since this new record?

SM: The two biggest changes have been the scope and quality of production, and my role as Ingrid's music director.

As MD, I have the opportunity to be creative on a new and unique level. It's almost like producing an album. There's still collaborative involvement but to build a show with forethought, insight and a vision, and to see it come together is quite beautiful and satisfying.

And because of Ingrid's continued success she's had time to solidify a camp of incredibly hard working and talented people... all of whom plan, communicate and execute on a tremendously competent level. The scale and caliber of production wouldn't be possible without them. We are family.

####What's the coolest thing you've seen or done since you started playing with Ingrid?

SM: The coolest thing?? I do not know.. I've seen so much of this country. I've explored so many cities on a bicycle (bring a bicycle). I've tasted so much delicious cuisine, met so many beautiful and generous people. I've been part of and supported some of the most talented artists and songwriters of my generation.. I've grown personally, matured creatively and excelled professionally.

Also, I once saw Billy buy $80 worth of smoked salmon at Pike Place Market.

####Would you have been at this point your careers had you stayed in Maine? Any advice for Maine musicians?

SM: Doubtful but you never know. My advice is this, in no particular order :
work your ass off..
put your art where lots of people can experience it
be humble
be a good hang
make and preserve meaningful connections
know the industry
stay healthy
